# 2025 Posit Plotnine Contest Submission

## Canada Employment Tracker


For the 2025 Posit Plotnine Contest, I used Quarto to create the [Canada Employment Tracker](https://victoryuan.com/labourcan/), which hosts my `plotnine` visualization. I also created a [tutorial](https://victoryuan.com/labourcan/02_develop_visualization.html) that walks through my process of creating the visualization.

## Render

```bash
uv run quarto preview
uv run quarto render
```
